    <h2>WHAT DO YOU DO?</h2>
    <p>I (at the time of writing) am a student studying software development at <a href="https://moringaschool.com/">Moringa School</a>.
    It is my hope that I will later come back here and update this statement by saying "I am a full
    -stack programmer/developer specialising in back-end programming"

    <h2>WHAT DO YOU LIKE?/WHAT ARE YOUR HOBBIES?</h2>
    <p>
        I like generally almost anything tech related, be it computers, servers, sattelites name it, 
        there's little in the tech industry that I am uninterested in.
        I like or rather I am into a range of activities, some of which I did some of which I still do.

    <h2>ACHIEVEMENTS</h2>
    <p>I have a Bachelors degree in Mathematics, which I usually say should
        have been a degree in the field of computers and software but life has to
        move.
    </p>
    <p>Currently I know enough html and css, nearly proficient in Javascript and Python
        and in the process of learning Reactjs and Ruby.
    </p>
    <p>
        I currently have only been able to deploy one project in the field of
        Javascript(with a subtle combination of css and html) which is a simple game
        of <a href="https://michael-murage.github.io/Rock-paper-scissors-project/compIndex.html">rock-paper-scissors</a>. The core aim of it was to demostrate the fundamentals
        of Javascript in the implementation of a web page.
